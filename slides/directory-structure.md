## Directory Structure

Directory structure follows _sock drawer_ approach (all files of the same type are grouped together).
Adding and maintaining files becomes significantly more complicated as number of files in the _drawer_ grows.

Adding/maintaining/removing a feature becomes a nightmare because files are so dispersed.

** Some container components are located in components directory and vice versa.
