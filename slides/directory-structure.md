## Directory Structure

Directory structure follows the _sock drawer_ approach (all files of the same type are grouped together).
Adding and maintaining files become significantly more complicated as number of files in the _drawer_ grows.
Maintaining/removing a feature becomes a nightmare because files are so dispersed.

Proposal:
Feature oriented directory structure, all feature files are grouped together in one directory.
All components, containers, actions, reducers, sagas etc. are grouped together in a feature directory.
