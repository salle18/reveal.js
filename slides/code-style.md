## Code Style

* Naming convention
* Code standards
* Code styleguide

For the reader of the codebase general look and feel of the codebase is volatile.
We can find a mix of camelCase, snake_case and kebab-case sometimes even in the single file.
Naming convention is not standardised and is applied for each particular case.
